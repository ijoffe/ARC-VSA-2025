# Vector Symbolic Algebras for the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus

This repository contains the source code associated with ["Vector Symbolic Algebras for the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus"](), our submission to the [ARC Prize 2025](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/arc-prize-2025) competition.

### Repository Organization

<!-- * **[`data/`](https://github.com/ijoffe/ARC-VSA-2025/tree/main/data)** contains all task data. We test on ARC-AGI itself (ARC-AGI-1: [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547), [code](https://github.com/fchollet/ARC-AGI/tree/master); ARC-AGI-2: [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11831), [code](https://github.com/arcprize/ARC-AGI-2/tree/main)) as well as simpler versions of interest (Sort-of-ARC: [paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=rCzfIruU5x5); 1D-ARC: [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18354), [data](https://github.com/khalil-research/1D-ARC); KidsARC: [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09734), [data](https://github.com/cstevenson-uva/kidsARC); ConceptARC: [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07141), [data](https://github.com/victorvikram/ConceptARC); MiniARC: [paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=F4RNpByoqP), [data](https://github.com/KSB21ST/MINI-ARC)). -->
* **[`paper/`](https://github.com/ijoffe/ARC-VSA-2025/tree/main/paper)** contains our paper and all associated figures.
* **[`src/`](https://github.com/ijoffe/ARC-VSA-2025/tree/main/src)** contains all code to implement our solver. Our code was submitted to the Kaggle competition [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/isaacjoffe/arc-solver-v2-submission).
